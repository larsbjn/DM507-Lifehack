/**
 * Two types of connectivity are defined for a directed graph:
 *
 * 1. Strong connectivity: If every vertex is reachable from every other
 * 2. Weak connectivity: If graph is connected by some path (irrespective of direction, so similar to un directed graph)
 *
 * Both can be found in O(V + E). Any graph can be divided into strongly connected components(SCC) i.e. components which
 * are strongly connected. SCCs can be found in linear time by finding loops (back edges) and then considering the whole
 * loop as a vertex and continuing. The process terminates when no directed loop remains and the number of SCCs is the
 * number of remaining vertices.
 *
 * Observe that if we create a DFS tree such that there are only tree edges then it can never have SCC with size greater
 * than 1. So, it is back edge and cross edge (under some circumstances) that create SCCs by re enforcing connections.
