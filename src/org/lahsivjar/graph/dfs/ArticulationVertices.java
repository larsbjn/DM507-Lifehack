/**
 * Point 1: Connectivity of an undirected graph is defined as the minimum number of vertices to remove so that the graph
 * can be disconnected.
 * Point 2: An articulation vertex is a vertex which is a single point of failure i.e. removing it disconnects the graph.
 *
 * With both point 1 and point 2 under consideration a graph with connectivity 1 will have an articulation vertex or a
 * graph with an articulation vertex will have connectivity 1.
 *
 * NOTE: For directed graph articulation vertices are of two types, weak articulation vertices and strong articulation
 * vertices. They can be understood simply as a vertex removing which increases the corresponding type of connected
 * component. For weak articulation point we can use the same algorithm as this class by replacing the edges of the
 * directed graph with undirected ones.
